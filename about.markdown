Hi! My name is Nikita Lisitsa, I'm a software developer from Saint Petersburg.

I've been programming since about 2010, with my primary insterests being C++, geometry, simulations, graphics, performance, and, recently, game developement.

I also teach real-time computer graphics in Saint Petersburg State University. 

You can try some of my games [on itch.io](https://lisyarus.itch.io/). They're generally pretty bad, although I've been getting better over time.

I've also written a beginner-friendly introductory [book on quantum chemistry](https://github.com/lisyarus/chembook) which shows how to compute some hydrogen atom electron orbitals with just some python.
